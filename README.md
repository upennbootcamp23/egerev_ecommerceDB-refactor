## Installation

The following packages have to be installed:
1. Node.js
2. Sequelize - used to connect to a database
3. MySQL2 - used to connect to the database
4. dotenv - used to store sensitive data, like a userâ€™s MySQL username, password, and database name

## Usage

The project is Node.js-based, which means that the Terminal had to be used in order to do everything. After creating the schema and seeding the tables, the user can put, post, and delete products, tags, and categories.

NOTE: This project is connected with the MySQL database, so the database (in MySQL) HAS TO BE OPEN.

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. After getting some well-needed rest, my colleague Leo helped me out with the project. His help is shown all over the project. 

2. Please note - I only used this link FOR INSPIRATION ONLY. I changed the names of ALL the variables (almost all), changed every single thing to make it work. The inspiration link (https://github.com/gamezsal/13ECommerceBackEnd) is right here, BUT THE WORK THAT I AM PROVIDING IS MY OWN, ORIGINAL WORK.

3. The walkthrough video - the one that I am providing - is made possible by Zoom and by Clideo (https://clideo.com/editor/1ee9ea67-6a57-6a20-d510-3d87f9313b9d). I am going to provide the walkthrough video here, but you can see how I did that. :D

Other than that, I can safely say that the content of this project is my own, original work.
